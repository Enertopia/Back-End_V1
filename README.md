These components are designed to interact with each other as part of a decentralized application (DApp) development. 

    RINPlatform Smart Contract (Solidity):
        This smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
        It defines functions for registering and transferring RINs.
        Users with the USER_ROLE can register RINs, and users with the ADMIN_ROLE can transfer RINs.
        It emits events when RINs are registered or transferred.

    web3Service.js (JavaScript):
        It uses the web3 library to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
        The registerRIN function interacts with the deployed RINPlatform contract by calling the registerRIN method.
        It constructs and sends transactions to the smart contract, expecting a response.

    RinRegistrationForm.js (React Component):
        This component provides a form for users to input RIN data, specifically the originationId.
        It uses Formik and Yup for form validation and handling form submissions.
        When the form is submitted, it calls the onSubmit function passed as a prop.

    App.js (React Component):
        The main application component.
        Imports the RinRegistrationForm and registerRIN functions.
        It defines a function handleRinSubmit that is called when the form is submitted. This function invokes the registerRIN function from web3Service.js.

Interactions:

    App.js uses the RinRegistrationForm component to collect user input.
    When the form in RinRegistrationForm.js is submitted, it calls the onSubmit function, which is set to handleRinSubmit in App.js.
    handleRinSubmit in App.js invokes the registerRIN function from web3Service.js to interact with the RINPlatform smart contract.
    The registerRIN function constructs a transaction and sends it to the Ethereum blockchain using the web3 library.
