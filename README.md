RIN registration form component interacts with the RINPlatform smart contract to register new RINs on the blockchain. Here is how they interact:

    The RIN registration form collects all the necessary data from the user like rinAssignmentCode, yearBatch etc.
    It validates the data and then passes it to the registerRIN helper method on submission.
    The registerRIN method takes the RIN data, connects to the blockchain using Web3, instantiates the RINPlatform contract, constructs the RIN data into the format expected by the contract, and then calls the registerRIN method on the contract.
    The registerRIN method in the RINPlatform contract creates a new RIN token by minting an NFT and emits a RINRegistered event with the tokenId and RIN data.
in summary:

    The React front-end collects & validates RIN data and passes it to a Web3 helper method
    The Web3 method constructs the data and calls the registerRIN contract method
    The contract mints an NFT with the RIN data and emits an event
    The React app can listen for the event to confirm registration
